# AI4I-Maintanence-Prediction
Predicting the Air Temperature based on Different Inputs using Machine Learning Algorithm ( Linear Regression ) and various techniques

I have performed Data Cleaning, Feature Selection, Feature Engineering, Feature Scaling, etc on data
  Then have used Machine Learning Algorithms for Prediction also it is created as web app
  
The AI4I-Maintanence-Prediction web app is made using Python, Streamlit, Exploratory Data Analysis, Machine Learing Algorithms such as Linear Regression, etc

Also before concluding to a Machine Learning Prediction model i have done rigourous testing with different techinques and have confirmed the accuracy of multipe models 
  after this procedure i have picked the best model
